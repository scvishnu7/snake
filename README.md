snake
=====

Classic snake on OpenGL. This snake game was my 1st game done on Turbo C while i was on my 1st semester. It was done on Turbo C with BGI graphic. 
It was not an achivement at all but it still keep me glad while i go through it.

Now i am linux user and recently i am learning OpenGL and it becomes my 1st game on OpenGL. 
Lets go ahead and see how much can be done using OpenGL. :-)
